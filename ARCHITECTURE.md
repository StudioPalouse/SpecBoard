# SpecBoard — Architecture

SpecBoard is a lightweight, spec-based product-management layer for teams doing
**spec-driven development**. Specs live as markdown in your git repo (canonical,
versioned with code, read by AI coding agents). SpecBoard layers the _product_
metadata — status, assignment, priority, backlog order, roadmap — **on top** of
those specs so PM, UX, and engineering can collaborate without editing files in a
terminal and without duplicating work into a separate tracker.

Think of it as a spec-native, lightweight ProductBoard / JIRA / Aha!.

## Why not just use spec-board / Spec Kit / JIRA?

- **spec-board** centralizes specs in Postgres, giving up git as the source of truth.
- **GitHub Spec Kit** is git-native but CLI-only — no PM layer, no metadata, no UI for PM/UX.
- **JIRA / Aha / ProductBoard** are heavyweight and disconnected from the actual specs,
  forcing duplicate authoring and brittle syncs.

SpecBoard keeps **spec content in git** and **metadata in a database**, joined by a
stable spec id.

## System of record

| Data                                                       | Home         | Why                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spec content (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`)            | **Git**      | Diff-able, versioned with code, read by agents                                |
| Metadata (status, assignee, priority, rank, tags, roadmap) | **Database** | Queryable, real-time, access-controlled; no spec-file thrash on a status flip |
| Spec index (content cache + git path/sha)                  | **Database** | Fast boards/search without hitting git on every render                        |

### Spec identity — the linchpin

Each spec carries a stable `id` (UUID) in YAML frontmatter. The DB `features` row is
keyed by `(repo_id, spec_id)`, **not** by path — so renames/moves never orphan
metadata. On first import of a spec without an `id`, the git service injects one via a
single commit (`packages/git` → `injectSpecId`). Path + blob `sha` are cached in
`spec_index` for fast lookup and drift/conflict detection.

Only the **leaf** level (Work Item) is spec-backed; the grouping levels above it
(Initiative / Epic / Feature) are **DB-native** rows with no git spec — each takes a
synthetic `spec_id` equal to its row id so every item is uniformly routable. Item
permalinks are type-segmented by level: `/{org}/{product}/backlog/{levelKey}/{specId}`
(the bare `/backlog/{specId}` still redirects). See
[`docs/adr/0002-work-item-leaf-and-typed-item-urls.md`](docs/adr/0002-work-item-leaf-and-typed-item-urls.md).

## Components

```
GitHub repo (specs/**, .specboard/config.yml)
   ▲ commits/PRs        │ webhooks + reads
   │                    ▼
Git Integration Service (GitHub App)  ── packages/git
   reads/parses specs · injects ids · reconciles on push · writes edits back
   │                                   ▲
   ▼ content + sha (index)             │ specs + metadata
Postgres  ── packages/db               │
   metadata (system of record) + spec index + RLS multi-tenancy
   ▲                                   │
   │                                   │
Next.js web app  ── apps/web           MCP server ── apps/mcp
   Backlog · Board · Roadmap ·         list_features · read_spec ·
   Feature detail (spec + metadata     update_status · get_relations
   + dependencies/relations)           (to coding agents)
```

- **`packages/core`** — framework-agnostic domain logic: spec frontmatter + markdown
  parser (`parseSpec`), status state machine (`canTransition`), `.specboard/config.yml`
  schema (`parseRepoConfig`), and the configurable work-tracking **levels** model
  (`resolveLevels`/`leafLevel`/`parentLevelKey`/`resolveLevelUpdate` — depth, the
  spec-backed leaf, and parent/child level rules). Unit-tested.
- **`packages/db`** — Drizzle schema (`workspaces`, `members`, `repositories`,
  `workspace_levels` (per-workspace hierarchy config — default Initiative → Epic →
  Feature → Work Item, where only the leaf is spec-backed), `features` (with a
  self-referential `parent_id` for the work hierarchy,
  a `level` column composite-FK'd to `workspace_levels`, a nullable `repo_id` for
  DB-native items above the leaf, and a fractional `rank` for manual board ordering),
  `feature_links` (typed dependencies/relations between features),
  `feature_github_links` (links a feature to a GitHub PR/issue/branch with cached
  state), `spec_index`, `comments`, `activity_log`, `saved_views` (per-user backlog
  filters), `board_preferences` (per-user board card-field choices), the
  deployment-global `github_app` credential row, plus the Better Auth
  `users`/`sessions`/`accounts`/`verifications` tables) + Postgres client. RLS
  policies in `infra/migrations`.
- **`packages/git`** — GitHub App client + reconciler (`reconcileSpecs`), webhook
  verification/affected-spec resolution, installation-repo listing (via `octokit`).
- **`packages/ui`** — shared design tokens / components.
- **`apps/web`** — Next.js App Router UI; left sidebar nav with light/dark theme;
  in-app auth via Better Auth (`/api/auth/*`: sign-up/in, email verification,
  password reset); routes for Board + Backlog (two views of one nav entry, with a
  per-hierarchy-level switcher), Roadmap, Feature detail (renders DB-native items
  without spec content), and `/settings/*` (Profile, Repositories, Company,
  Hierarchy levels editor, …).
- **`apps/mcp`** — MCP server exposing prioritized, status-aware specs to agents.

## Key flows

1. **Connect repo** — an admin creates the deployment's GitHub App in one click
   (GitHub App *manifest* flow; credentials stored encrypted in `github_app`),
   installs it and picks repos, then connects one → scan `specs/**` per
   `.specboard/config.yml` → create `features` + `spec_index`, injecting missing `id`s.
   Each spec's work item is homed under a Feature grouping — found or created by a
   stable key (the spec's `feature:` frontmatter, else its folder), so the hierarchy
   fills in on import without overriding any parent set later in the app (ADR 0002).
2. **Reconcile on push** — `push` webhook → re-parse changed specs → update `spec_index`;
   `blob_sha` detects drift/conflicts. The same webhook handles `pull_request`/`issues`
   events to refresh the cached state of any `feature_github_links` (open → merged/closed).
3. **Edit spec in UI** — save → `packages/git` writes a commit or opens a PR
   (`writeMode`) → webhook confirms → index updates.
4. **Edit metadata in UI** — writes straight to DB (no git churn), real-time to boards.
5. **Agent via MCP** — `list_features` / `read_spec` / `update_status` /
   `get_relations`: agents act on prioritized, assigned, status-aware specs, and
   respect dependency sequencing (a feature's `blocks` / `blockedBy`).

## Multi-tenancy

`workspace` is the tenant root; every tenant row carries `workspace_id` and Postgres
**RLS** isolates tenants (`specboard_is_member(workspace_id)` via the
`app.user_id` transaction-local session variable set by the app).
SaaS = many workspaces on shared infra; self-host = a single workspace.

Org and product are **URL path prefixes** (`/{org}/{product}/…`); the slug is a hint
whose authority is re-checked against membership server-side, and a product is a DB
grouping (`features.product_id`) that can span repos. See
[`docs/adr/0001-multi-tenancy-url-and-product-grouping.md`](docs/adr/0001-multi-tenancy-url-and-product-grouping.md).

## Open-core boundary

- **Open source (Apache-2.0):** spec editor, kanban/backlog/roadmap, GitHub git sync,
  MCP server, single-workspace self-host, docker-compose deploy.
- **Commercial (hosted SaaS):** multi-tenant hosting, SSO/SAML/SCIM, advanced
  analytics/insights, premium integrations (Jira/Linear/Slack), audit logs, support.

Commercial code stays in clearly separated, flag-gated modules so the OSS build is
fully functional standalone (no crippleware).

## Tech stack

Turborepo + pnpm workspaces · TypeScript · Next.js (App Router) · Drizzle ORM ·
Postgres (RLS multi-tenancy) · Better Auth · `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ·
`octokit` (GitHub App).

## Deployment

- **Self-host:** `infra/docker-compose.yml` (web + Postgres).
- **SaaS:** Fly.io Machines running `infra/web.Dockerfile` (the same image
  self-hosters run) + Fly Managed Postgres; auth via Better Auth in-app.
  Two environments: test.specboard.ai (every push to `main`) and
  app.specboard.ai (manual promote). Migrations in `infra/migrations/`.

## Local file mode (development/testing)

When `DATABASE_URL` is unset, `apps/web` swaps its store implementation
(`apps/web/src/lib/store`) for a filesystem-backed one: specs are read directly
from this repo's `specs/` directory and metadata persists to
`.specboard/local-metadata.json`. Same UI, zero infrastructure — useful for UI
testing and for dogfooding SpecBoard on its own specs. Postgres mode is the
deployment shape.

## Status

**Active build.** Working: web UI (Backlog · Board · Roadmap · Feature detail,
base shadcn styling), spec parser + status workflow (`packages/core`), Drizzle
schema/migrations/seed (`packages/db`), DB-backed MCP tools (`apps/mcp`), local
file mode; full auth (Better Auth: email/password sign-up/in, email
verification, password reset, account/company settings, optional consumer-domain
blocking, session-gated writes); GitHub App sync (`packages/git`) — one-click
in-app App setup (manifest flow), repo install + connect picker, push reconcile
into `features`/`spec_index`, stable-id injection. Interactive board:
drag-and-drop status change + manual reorder, click-to-edit drawer, per-user
customizable card fields. GitHub feature linking: attach a PR/issue/branch to a
feature, rolled up to parents, with live state refresh via the webhook. Still
stubbed: editing spec content from the UI (PR write-back), spec **deletion**
handling. See `docs/PLAN.md` for the build plan, `docs/BACKLOG.md` for shipped
work (including the configurable hierarchy), and `docs/RUNBOOK-github-sync.md` for setup.
