 * Middleware. Two jobs:
 *
 * 1. Normalize a stray trailing space in the GitHub App's hand-configured
 *    "Setup URL". A space there makes GitHub redirect to
 *    `/api/v1/github/setup%20?installation_id=…`, a path segment that doesn't
 *    match the real route, so the admin hits a 404 mid-install. We catch any
 *    trailing-whitespace variant and redirect to the canonical route, keeping
 *    the `?installation_id=…&setup_action=…` query intact. The self-host
 *    manifest flow sets this URL programmatically, so only the manually
 *    configured hosted App can drift; this is the safety net for it.
 *
 * 2. Inject the active org slug (the first path segment) as the `x-org-slug`
 *    request header so server code can resolve the tenant without threading
 *    `params.org` through every page (ADR 0001, D3). Authority still comes from
 *    a validated membership in `requireWorkspaceAccess` — this header is only a
 *    hint. API routes resolve their own scope, so they're left untouched.
