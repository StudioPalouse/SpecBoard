# Repo Spec Import

Connect a GitHub repository and import every spec matched by
`.specboard/config.yml` into the board, injecting stable `id` frontmatter
where it is missing.

## Problem

Teams adopting Specboard already have specs in their repo. Onboarding must not
require renaming files or hand-editing frontmatter across dozens of specs.

## Requirements

- Scan the repo for files matching `specGlobs` on first connect.
- Create a `features` row plus `spec_index` cache entry per spec.
- Inject a generated UUID `id` via a single, batched commit when absent.
- Surface import progress and parse errors in the UI.

## Out of Scope

- Non-GitHub providers (GitLab, Bitbucket).
